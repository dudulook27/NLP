Q1. Summarize the reasons of overfitting and underfitting. Put them ingithub repository.
A1. The possible reasons for overliftting are
    1> Training data has outliner that model does not to ingore
    2> Training data is too less or not representing the whole data set
    3> The model itself is too complex with too much parameters that losing the proper focus
    The possiblereasons for underliftting are
    1> Fail to identify the necessary features of the object
    2> The model is too simple without enough parameters

Q3. Writing down three sceneries that machine learning has been used now.
A3. 1> Facial fortune teller App recently became popular in Weibo recently. By learning the feature of the face photo the App is trying to predict the personality.
    2> Medical photo diagnosing, by learning the x-ray photo corellation with cancer, the model could predict cancer by study the x-ray photo feature.
    3> Matching skills and jobs, by learning the corelation of job opening and candidate skill to match the right candidate with vacancies.

Q4. Come out with three new sceneries with which machine learning may be applied.
A4. 1> Infectious disease prediction. By learning the feature of infectious disease spread over, could early identify the threshold of infectious disease break out
    2> Learn the corelation of raining record and aggreculture merchandize product price trend to predict price
    3> Learn what are important feasuresthat driving a thing to happen.
